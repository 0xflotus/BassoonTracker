<h2>What is a tracker?</h2>
Tracker music became popular on the Amiga platform in the 80s, with Protracker as best known example, and continued on the PC, spearheaded by Fasttracker.<br>

Even today the tracker concept is still used in modern music software as <a href="https://www.renoise.com/" target="_blank">Renoise</a> and <a href="http://users.notam02.no/~kjetism/radium/" target="_blank">Radium</a>.

Tracker programs where made by developers for developers: <br>
You don't enter notes on a musical bar, you enter notes by typing hexadecimal numbers in a grid and you apply effects by entering even more numbers.
<br>
<br>Unlike traditional music notation, time is usually represented vertically instead of horizontally, so sequential notes are underneath each other and playback goes from top to bottom.
<br><br>
Multiple number/notes in the same column form a "track", multiple tracks form a "pattern" and multiple patterns form a song.
